Vehicle Parking Management System with Booking and Receipt Functionality
This system uses a combination of technologies (HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL) to manage vehicle parking and booking. Here's a breakdown of the functionalities and the role of each technology:

Functionalities:

Car Park Booking: Users can search for available parking spaces based on date and time, and book a slot in advance.
Parking Management: The system keeps track of booked and available parking spaces.
Receipt Generation: Upon booking confirmation or payment, a receipt is generated for the user.
Technology Usage:

HTML: Provides the structure and content of the web pages, including forms for user input (search, booking details) and displaying information (available spaces, booking confirmation).
CSS: Styles the HTML elements to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. This could include layouts, fonts, colors, and button designs.
PHP: Acts as the server-side scripting language that handles user interactions and database communication. When a user searches for availability or books a parking space, PHP scripts process the information and interact with the database.
MySQL: The relational database management system stores information about parking spaces, bookings, and user details.
Here's a possible breakdown of the functionalities and how they might be implemented:

User Interface (HTML & CSS):

The user interface will have web pages for:
Searching for available parking spaces (search form with date and time selection).
Displaying available parking spaces.
Booking a parking space (booking form with vehicle details).
Viewing booking confirmation and receipt.
CSS will style these pages to make them user-friendly and visually appealing.
Booking Functionality (PHP & MySQL):

When a user searches for available spaces, a PHP script will connect to the MySQL database.
The script will query the database to find parking spaces that are not booked for the requested date and time.
The script will then display the available spaces on the webpage.
When a user books a parking space, a PHP script will be triggered.
The script will record the booking details (user information, vehicle details, date, and time) in the MySQL database.
The script will update the parking space status to "booked" in the database.
Upon successful booking, the script will generate a receipt containing the booking details and potentially a QR code for easy access.
Receipt Generation (PHP & HTML):

When a booking is confirmed, a PHP script can generate a receipt containing details like:
Booking reference number
User information
Vehicle details
Date and time of booking
Parking space number (if applicable)
Amount paid (if applicable)
This receipt information can be displayed on the webpage as HTML content or sent to the user's email as an attachment (potentially in PDF format).
Additional Considerations:

The system might require user authentication (login) to manage bookings and access receipts.
Payment processing can be integrated if the system involves paid parking.
Security measures should be implemented to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
